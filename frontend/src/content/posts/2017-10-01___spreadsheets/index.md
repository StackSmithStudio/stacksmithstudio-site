As I've become more mature as a web developer, I've seen more of the development world and what it has to offer.  We've moved through web frameowrk fads (jquery, AngularJS, React), general tech scene fads (Big Data, VR, Bitcoin, Machine Learning) and produt development fads (Waterfall, Agile, XP).  It has been a lot to behold and too much to keep up with.  I've done my best to follow what I think of as "best technological practices".  And one day in the shower (where shower thoughts come from) I had a very humbling idea most everything I've done as a developer boils down to handling and modifying spreadsheets.

Now you must say that this is super reductionist (and it definately is) but really though spreadsheets are not easy.  Spreadsheets are very hard.  How do you handle a spreadsheet with millions if not billions of rows?  How do you handle a spreadsheet that is accessed by millions of people at once.  These are the hard technological problems.

What is a website which is a service?  Lets say Facebook... handling content which is your personal spreadsheet to consume.  Editing spredsheets on other developer's walls.  How about Uber.  When you open your phone you send a message to update a drivers spreadsheet saing you are available to be picked up.  The rest of it is legwork (real work).  

Image a site without UI like any of it.  Lets say seamless a food delivery service.  You would just be seeing a spreadsheet which lists restaurands and ids.  You select the id and look for a spreadsheet which belogns the restaurnt.  You would command f search for their address in the restaurants spreadsheet.  When you find it, you will see a column for each meal maybe a meal Id and and url which checks the web for a spreadsheet to find the image of the meal... you get the idea.

What about REAL programming concerns like security... well I'm all that means is that you are not editing the spreadsheet yourself.  We are hiding the spreadsheet from you and have a set of rules to show you where your spreadsheet is.  You give us your password and we do some math equation which responds with an id to for where to find your spreadsheet.  Once you find it you
