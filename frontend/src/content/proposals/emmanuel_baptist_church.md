#### Proposal for website services

## WHY HAVE A WEBSITE?

---

### Websites are your face to your online audience.

### Websites are your face to your online audience.

- They show people what you do.
- They give people knowledge of how to interact with your services.
- They show your message.
- They communicate what you offer.

### Why for EBC?

## NEED

---

### After looking over your website

![jpeg](magnifying_glass.jpeg)

---

### After looking over your website (pros)

- it is a very interactive website
- it is strongly designed full of bright colors
- displays current events readily on the home page

![png](site_interactive.png)

---

#### Still it is hard to find meaningful information about services.

![png](service_times.png)
- Not on the front page
- What is the Alternative?
- Do you mean Alternate?  Alternate weeks?

---

#### Some best practices aren't being followed.

![png](no_menu.png)
Where's the menu?

---

#### Some best practices aren't being followed (cont).

![png](ohhh_menu.png)
Ohhh there's the menu!

---

#### There are some pages that lead to empty information.

![png](no_info.png)
... still waiting

---

#### It's very difficult to navigate on mobile.

## GOALS

---

### Your site should be simple to use

![unsplash.com](https://as1.ftcdn.net/jpg/00/69/02/14/500_F_69021405_4N6x5rfqo85wlky09HyaeAm9xDr5aklV.jpg)

---

#### Recommendations

- A simpler interface for website (especially on mobile mobile).
- removal of dead links (don't bring you to another page) or pages that have no information.
- A front page that displays relevant service times and church projects.
- Analytics to see how many users donate, who is on the site and when and just to track which pages the members use.

---

## STEPS OPTIONS

---

### Two possibilities to support EBC.

---

### Option 1: Cleaning up existing Wordpress site which involves:

- removing dead links
- This requires just managing the Wordpress content and keeping it up to date.  
- Also cleaning up pastor's blog.
- Also adding Google analytics to see how the congregation uses the site to see which pages are useful and which pages need help.    

---

#### Option 1: Cost/Benefit

With this option the work will be using the current architecture but it will be more work (if even possible) to change the flow of the site.

---

### Option 2: Rebuild the website.

- With this option, work will be done with your designer to rebuild the site however you want.
- There will be a panel to upload content via Wordpress or Netlify.
- Assistance will be given with any issues concerning user flow and organization of data/content.

---

#### Option 2: Rebuild mobile experience

- The moble experience will also be cleaned up on the site so it is simpler to use.
- Easy navigation to service times.
- Easy to use menu.

---

#### Option 2: Event Upload Control panel.

- You will be given access to a event uploading for so you can upload events yourself.
- You just need to upload the event to a control panel and it will be consistent in the entire site.
- Will update the calendars and update links to the events.

---

#### You will not need to contact anyone to update events on the site.  It can be done all in-house!

---

### Option 1 vs Option 2

- Option 1 will be quicker in the short term
- Option 2 will only cost more up front and will cost only a maintenance fee afterwards.
